# Final Step - Add Admin Environment Variable

## Current Status:
✅ Bypass token added to frontend project  
⚠️ Need to add admin environment variable

## Complete the Setup:

Add ONE more environment variable to your `workspace` project in Vercel:

**Variable:**
- Name: `VITE_ENABLE_ADMIN`
- Value: `true`

**Location:** Vercel Dashboard → `workspace` project → Settings → Environment Variables

## After Adding This Variable:
Your site will automatically redeploy and show:
- Vehicle inventory from database

This is the final step to make your production site match your development environment exactly.
