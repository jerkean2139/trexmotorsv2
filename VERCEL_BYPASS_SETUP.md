# T-Rex Motors - Vercel Protection Bypass Setup

## ✅ Code Updated for Protection Bypass

The frontend code has been updated to include the `x-vercel-protection-bypass` header for all API calls to the protected backend.

## 🔧 Required Steps to Complete Setup:

### Step 1: Create Bypass Secret in Backend Project ✅ COMPLETED
✅ You've successfully created the bypass secret for the backend project

### Step 2: Add Environment Variables to Frontend Project ✅ BYPASS TOKEN ADDED

**Still need to add:**
- Name: `VITE_ENABLE_ADMIN`
- Value: `true`

Go to Vercel Dashboard → `workspace` project → **Settings → Environment Variables**
Add the admin variable and save (Vercel will auto-redeploy)

## 🎯 Expected Result:
After adding both environment variables:
- ✅ API calls will bypass Vercel protection using the secret header
- ✅ Frontend will connect to your backend database
- ✅ Vehicle inventory will load from live data
- ✅ Admin interface will be fully functional

## 📝 How It Works:
- Your backend stays protected from unauthorized access
- The frontend includes the bypass token in API request headers
- Vercel allows these requests to pass through to your backend
- All functionality works as intended while maintaining security

**New Production URL:** https://workspace-fcfknzdgv-jeremys-projects-0f68a4ab.vercel.app

Once you complete the environment variable setup, your production site will work exactly like your development environment!
