Yes, you are definitely on the right track! Here’s a concise summary of where you are and what the next key points are:

What You’ve Done Well:
Identified the CORS problem and fixed CORS configuration to allow your frontend domain(s).

Created a simple test API endpoint (/api/test) to verify deployment and routing.

Confirmed environment variables are set correctly in Vercel.

Realized that the serverless functions are deployed but API routes are returning 404.

Suspected the issue might be with Vercel’s routing, folder structure, or vercel.json config.

Tested and tweaked your vercel.json to meet Vercel’s expectations for serverless API-only projects.

Updating the frontend with the new backend URLs dynamically to match deployments.

Created an index.ts route as a fallback to test base connectivity to the API.

Next Steps and Recommendations:
1. Double-check your serverless functions folder structure
Vercel expects your API routes inside /api folder at root of your project, not nested inside subfolders.

If your project root is admin-backend, verify that /api exists directly under that, with your .ts files inside.

Example structure:

pgsql
Copy
admin-backend/
  api/
    test.ts
    public/
      vehicles.ts
      featured.ts
2. Check your vercel.json for correct configuration
For serverless functions only (no frontend), your config should look like this:

json
Copy
{
  "version": 2,
  "functions": {
    "api/**/*.ts": {
      "runtime": "vercel-nodejs@3.1.0"
    }
  },
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/api/(.*)", "dest": "/api/$1.ts" }
  ]
}
This config tells Vercel to treat api folder files as serverless functions and map routes correctly.

3. Verify deployment logs carefully for any 404 or routing errors
Look at Vercel logs to see if functions are being built/deployed correctly.

Check that the API endpoints show up in Vercel’s dashboard under functions.

4. Test the simplest API routes first
Hit the /api/test endpoint directly (via curl or browser).

If this works, move on to more complex routes.

5. Make sure frontend URLs match backend deployments
Your frontend calls must target the correct backend URL, matching latest deployment.

Use environment variables in frontend to dynamically switch URLs.

6. Check authentication or middleware that could block routes
Ensure any auth middleware or SSO is disabled or properly configured for your public APIs.

Temporarily disable or bypass middleware to isolate issues.

Summary
You’ve isolated the core issue to serverless function routing on Vercel and environment/auth setup. The main action is to:

Fix folder structure and vercel.json to ensure Vercel properly recognizes and routes API serverless functions.

Test simple endpoints first.

Confirm frontend targets the correct backend URL.

Gradually add back auth and complex logic.
