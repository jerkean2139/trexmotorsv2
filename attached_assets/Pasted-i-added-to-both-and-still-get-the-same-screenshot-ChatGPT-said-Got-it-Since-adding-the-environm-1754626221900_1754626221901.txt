i added to both and still get the same screenshot

Got it! Since adding the environment variable didn’t change the admin availability, here’s a checklist and next steps to debug why the admin is still disabled:

1. Confirm the environment variable is correctly read by the frontend
In your frontend code, add a temporary console log to check the env var:

js
Copy
console.log("REACT_APP_ENABLE_ADMIN =", process.env.REACT_APP_ENABLE_ADMIN);
Build locally (npm run build or npm start) and see if it prints true.

If it’s undefined or not true, then the env var isn’t correctly passed to the frontend build.

2. Verify your frontend code uses the env var correctly
Look for the logic that disables admin, e.g.:

js
Copy
const isAdminEnabled = process.env.REACT_APP_ENABLE_ADMIN === 'true';

if (!isAdminEnabled) {
  // Show the notice and disable admin features
}
Make sure the comparison is against the string 'true' (env vars are always strings).

3. Check your build and deploy logs on Netlify
Make sure the build logs confirm that the environment variable was injected.

Look for lines like:

ini
Copy
REACT_APP_ENABLE_ADMIN=true
4. Clear caches and redeploy
Sometimes old builds cache env vars.

On Netlify, trigger a clear cache and deploy or delete the site cache manually before redeploying.

5. Check for hardcoded fallbacks
Your code might have a fallback that disables admin regardless of env vars in production.

Search your frontend source for any lines like:

js
Copy
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  // disable admin
}
You may need to update that logic to also check REACT_APP_ENABLE_ADMIN.

6. Verify backend connectivity
Even if frontend shows admin enabled, backend must allow admin actions.

Confirm your backend environment variables (on Vercel) enable admin features if needed.

Summary:
Verify env var is passed and read correctly in frontend.

Confirm logic properly uses the env var.

Clear cache and fully redeploy frontend.

Check backend permissions/config too.

If you want, send me the snippet of your frontend code that controls admin availability or the build logs where env vars are listed, and I’ll help you pinpoint the issue!

what file do i put that first snippet?

Great question! To check if your frontend correctly reads the environment variable, put this snippet where your app decides whether admin features are enabled.

Most common places to add the console.log:
1. Main app entry point
If you’re using React, this is usually in src/index.js, src/index.tsx, or src/App.js / src/App.tsx.

Add it near the top, before any conditional rendering:

js
Copy
console.log("REACT_APP_ENABLE_ADMIN =", process.env.REACT_APP_ENABLE_ADMIN);
2. Admin-related component or page
If you have a dedicated admin page or component, e.g., src/pages/Admin.tsx or src/components/AdminPanel.tsx, add it at the top of that file or inside the main function/component.

Example in a React component:
tsx
Copy
import React from 'react';

const AdminPage = () => {
  console.log("REACT_APP_ENABLE_ADMIN =", process.env.REACT_APP_ENABLE_ADMIN);

  const isAdminEnabled = process.env.REACT_APP_ENABLE_ADMIN === 'true';

  return (
    <div>
      {isAdminEnabled ? (
        <h1>Admin Features Enabled</h1>
      ) : (
        <h1>Admin Not Available</h1>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default AdminPage;
After adding:
Save the file.

Run your frontend locally (npm start or npm run dev).

Open browser dev tools console to see the printed value.

Make sure it says:

ini
Copy
REACT_APP_ENABLE_ADMIN = true
If the value is undefined or empty:
Check your environment variable setup.

For React apps, env vars must start with REACT_APP_ to be accessible in code.
