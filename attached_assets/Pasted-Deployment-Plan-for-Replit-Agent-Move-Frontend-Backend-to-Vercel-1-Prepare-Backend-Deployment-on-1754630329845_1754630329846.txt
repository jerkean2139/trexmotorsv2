Deployment Plan for Replit Agent: Move Frontend + Backend to Vercel
1. Prepare Backend Deployment on Vercel (If not done)
Ensure backend code is pushed to GitHub repo.

Confirm vercel.json and package.json are configured correctly for serverless functions.

Set necessary backend environment variables (e.g., DATABASE_URL, SESSION_SECRET) in Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings → Environment Variables.

2. Prepare Frontend for Vercel Deployment
Confirm frontend code is in a separate folder/repo (or monorepo with frontend folder).

Update frontend config to use relative API paths (/api/) or point to Vercel backend URL if separate.

Ensure frontend build script is working (e.g., npm run build with Vite/React/etc).

Make sure environment variables for frontend (e.g., VITE_ENABLE_ADMIN=true) are set for Vercel frontend project.

3. Create or Link Frontend Project on Vercel
Use Vercel CLI or UI to create a new Vercel project for frontend.

Connect frontend repo or folder.

Set frontend environment variables in the Vercel dashboard exactly like Netlify’s VITE_ENABLE_ADMIN=true.

Set build & output settings to match your frontend framework (e.g., Vite).

4. Configure Frontend to Backend Connection
If backend and frontend are in same project, API routes are under /api/*. No URL change needed.

If backend is separate, set frontend env var (e.g., VITE_API_URL=https://admin-backend-xxx.vercel.app/api) and update frontend API calls accordingly.

5. Deploy Frontend to Vercel
Run vercel --prod or push to main branch triggering deployment.

Check Vercel logs for build success and environment variables recognition.

Confirm frontend loads and admin UI shows enabled admin access (no warning).

Test frontend calls to backend APIs are successful.

6. Clean up Netlify
Once frontend is stable on Vercel, disable or archive Netlify frontend deployment to avoid confusion.

7. Post Deployment Testing
Verify frontend admin UI loads fully with admin enabled.

Test API endpoints from frontend.

Test session/login flows (especially with Vercel SSO disabled if needed).

Monitor logs for errors or environment issues.

Optional Extras:
Automate environment sync between frontend and backend projects via scripts or GitHub Actions.

Add custom domain and HTTPS setup on Vercel for frontend and backend projects.

Copy
1. Confirm backend repo and environment variables are correctly set on Vercel.
2. Prepare frontend code for Vercel (relative API paths, build scripts).
3. Create frontend project on Vercel and set frontend env vars (`VITE_ENABLE_ADMIN=true`).
4. Deploy frontend using `vercel --prod`.
5. Test frontend and backend connection; fix any API URL or CORS issues.
6. After stable deployment, remove Netlify frontend deployment.
7. Verify admin UI works and login is functional.
