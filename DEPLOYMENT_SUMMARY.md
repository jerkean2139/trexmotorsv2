# T-Rex Motors Vercel Deployment - January 2025

## Current Status: Ready for Deployment âœ…

### What's Working Perfectly in Development:
- Admin interface with green "Production Admin Mode" enabled
- Successful login with credentials (admin/trex2025!)
- Vehicle inventory management fully functional
- All API endpoints responding correctly
- Environment variables properly recognized
- No CORS issues or authentication problems

### Code Prepared for Vercel:
- All API calls converted to relative paths (/api/*)
- Frontend build tested and successful
- vercel.json configuration created
- Deployment scripts ready

### Next Steps After Vercel Deployment:
1. Set environment variable: `VITE_ENABLE_ADMIN=true` in Vercel dashboard
2. Verify the production site matches current development experience
3. Test admin login and vehicle management functionality
4. Archive Netlify deployment once confirmed working

### Expected Result:
The Vercel deployment should look and function identically to the current development preview, with:
- Green admin banner instead of yellow warning
- Working login form
- Full vehicle management capabilities
- Professional T-Rex Motors branding and functionality
