# Security Issue Fixed: Database Credentials Removal

## Problem
Netlify detected hardcoded database credentials in `migrate-to-production.js` lines 9-10, causing build failures due to security scanning.

## Solution Applied
✅ **Removed hardcoded credentials** from all source files
✅ **Replaced with environment variables**:
- `DEV_DATABASE_URL` for development database
- `PROD_DATABASE_URL` or `DATABASE_URL` for production database
✅ **Added validation** to ensure environment variables are set
✅ **Created `.env.example`** for reference

## Environment Variables Needed

### For Netlify (if running migration):
```
PGHOST=your-database-host
PGDATABASE=your-database-name
PGUSER=your-username
PGPASSWORD=your-password


## Files Changed
- `migrate-to-production.js` - Credentials removed, environment variables added
- `.env.example` - Created for reference
- `SECURITY-FIX.md` - This documentation

## Next Steps
1. Commit these changes to remove secrets from source code
2. Add environment variables to Netlify dashboard if needed
3. Netlify build should now pass security scanning
