# Vercel Frontend Fix - Authentication Issue

## Problem
The Vercel frontend deployment `workspace-oy8cx6rgj-jeremys-projects-0f68a4ab.vercel.app` returns a 401 "Authentication Required" error instead of showing the T-Rex Motors website.

## Root Cause
The Vercel project has protection/authentication settings enabled, likely due to multiple deployments or project configuration.

## Solution (When deployment quota resets)

### Step 1: Clean Deploy with Public Access
```bash
cd client
rm -rf .vercel
vercel --prod --yes
```

The updated `vercel.json` already includes `"public": true` which should disable authentication.

### Step 2: If Still Protected, Manual Vercel Dashboard Steps
1. Go to vercel.com dashboard
2. Find the "workspace" project
3. Go to Settings → General
4. Under "Deployment Protection", set to "Disabled" or "Only Preview Deployments"
5. Redeploy with `vercel --prod --yes`

### Step 3: Update Backend CORS (if needed)
If new frontend URL is generated, update the CORS allowedOrigins in:
- `admin-backend/api/public/vehicles.ts`
- `admin-backend/api/public/featured.ts`

## Current Working Components
✅ **Backend**: https://admin-backend-lyart.vercel.app
✅ **Database**: PostgreSQL with 20+ vehicles
✅ **Local Development**: http://localhost:5000 (fully functional)

## Temporary Workaround
For immediate testing, the local development server at http://localhost:5000 is fully functional with backend integration.

## Next Deployment Time
Vercel quota resets in approximately 2 hours from 2:30 PM.
