# Alternative Solutions for Vercel Protection Issue

## Problem: Protection Bypass Button Greyed Out

The "Protection Bypass for Automation" button is greyed out, which typically happens when:
1. The protection isn't fully configured
2. Plan limitations (some features require Pro/Enterprise)
3. The project doesn't have the right protection type enabled

## Alternative Solutions:

### Option 1: Disable Protection Completely
Since this is for your own website and backend, you could:
1. Go to `admin-backend` project → Settings → Security
2. **Turn OFF all protection features:**
   - Disable "Vercel Authentication"
   - Disable "Password Protection" 
   - Disable any other security features
3. This makes the backend publicly accessible (like development)

### Option 2: Use Password Protection Instead
1. Go to `admin-backend` project → Settings → Security
2. Enable "Password Protection" instead of full authentication
3. Set a simple password
4. Update frontend to include basic auth headers

### Option 3: Allowlist Frontend Domain
1. Go to `admin-backend` project → Settings → Security
2. Look for "Trusted IPs" or "Domain Allowlist"
3. Add your frontend domain: `workspace-i3i4coxo5-jeremys-projects-0f68a4ab.vercel.app`

### Option 4: Subdomain Deployment
Deploy both frontend and backend under the same Vercel project to avoid cross-origin protection issues.

## Recommended: Try Option 1 First
Since this is your personal dealership website, disabling protection on the backend is the simplest solution and mirrors your development environment.
