# Vercel SSO Authentication Issue - Critical

## Problem Identified
Your Vercel backend has **project-level SSO authentication** enabled, which is blocking all API calls with authentication redirects.

## Evidence
- API calls return HTML authentication pages instead of JSON
- Error: "Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "..." shows HTML being returned
- Direct curl test confirms SSO interception

## Root Cause
The backend Vercel project `admin-backend-etkz45d8r-jeremys-projects-0f68a4ab` has SSO protection enabled at the project level, blocking all API endpoints.

## Solution Required
**Disable Vercel project-level SSO:**

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → `admin-backend` project
2. **Settings** → **Security** 
3. **Disable "Vercel Authentication"** / **Project Protection**
4. Save changes

## Temporary Workaround Applied
- Reverted to direct backend URL calls to bypass proxy issues
- Frontend configured to call backend directly
- This works but requires CORS to be properly configured on backend

## After Disabling SSO
Once SSO is disabled on the backend project:
1. API calls will return proper JSON responses
2. Admin login will work correctly  
3. Vehicle inventory will load from database
4. All functionality will match development environment

## Current Status
- Frontend deployed successfully to Vercel
- Backend blocked by SSO authentication
- Waiting for SSO to be disabled on backend project
