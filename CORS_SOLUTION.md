# CORS Issue Resolution

## Problem Identified:
Your frontend (workspace-i3i4coxo5-jeremys-projects-0f68a4ab.vercel.app) couldn't access your backend (admin-backend-etkz45d8r-jeremys-projects-0f68a4ab.vercel.app) due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions.

## Solution Applied:
âœ… Added CORS middleware to backend that allows:
- Your production frontend domain
- Your development Replit domain  
- Local development URLs
- Credentials (cookies/sessions)
- The x-vercel-protection-bypass header

## Backend Update Deployed:
The backend now includes proper CORS headers to allow communication between your frontend and backend domains.

## Expected Result:
After the backend deployment completes:
- CORS errors will disappear
- API calls will succeed 
- Admin login will work
- Vehicle data will load from database
- Full functionality restored

Your T-Rex Motors site should now work perfectly in production!
